December 5, 2016, Team Phil, Meeting 3 with Harihar

Notes:

    - Recapping progress since last meeting. Doing a small pre-demo with Harihar to see how the project has progressed.
        - UI is very cool (good job Phil)

    - Going over what we have left to do:
        - Heroku has protection through CSRF token (?). HTTPS does not protect you from CSRF.
        - SeaSurf ExpressJS middleware

    - Deployment (?)
        - Said he would get back to us after his staff meeting later in the day.

    - Phil's Mongoose question:
        - Trying to get all documents wherein their list of ids has this id
            - $in hasn't worked
        - $in, elemMatch and find are all things that tend to work, but which havent worked for us
