November 28, 2016, Team Phil, Meeting 2 with Harihar

Notes:

    - Talked about design doc feedback and some concerns we had about some of the points in it.
    - Talked about scheduling an office hours for tomorrow so that we can go over a problem that we are
        persistently having.

    - Redesigning Models:
        - Split model into Lists (which contain the info about the items in a ranking) and Rankings which
            are the actual ordered items representing someone's opinion
        - Don't create a separate Consensus model. Simply compute it on page load.

    - Data Model:
        - Don't use present tense verbs! (instead of 'posts', use 'posted')

    - Advice
        - Don't store anything in the file system.
        - Leave at least a day for deployment.
        - Spend a lot of time on the data model.
        - Security:
            - CSRF - React package called SeaSurf
            - XSS - Should do this.
            - Threat Model:
                - Say the capabilities that the attacker has (usually just whatever a user can do).
                - Sniff network packets (use HTTPS).
                - What happens if the attacker has a huge botnet (can't really protect against that).
        - Go through demo for any additional bugs.

    - Redesign:
        - Follow the redesign email advice.
        - Mention the fact that some people may have already voted and how we handle that for new items added.
