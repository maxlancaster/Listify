November 21, 2016, Team Phil, Meeting 1 with Harihar

Notes:

    - Starting off with introductions.

    - Explaining some discrepancies/confusion around app:
        - Incentives (FINAL):
            - No need for incentives for private rankings.
            - However, for public rankings, an upvote/downvote ("not necessary") or a description.
                - People can be doing this just for fun.
                - People can be collecting data through rankings.
                - Add titles and descriptions for consensuses so that users can see what each ranking is about.
        - Comments (FINAL):
            - Should include comments for each ranking so that people can explain why they ranked the way they did.
            - Make it configurable if you want to show rankings' comments.
        - Closing rankings (MVP):
            - Timer or manual shutdown.
            - Lean toward not showing consensus to each user until after each user has submitted.
            - Show consensus to all users once the creator has closed the ranking.
        - Search Feature (FINAL):

    - For Drag and Drop (MVP):
        - For now, just update when the item is dropped. No need to update the number while the item is being ranked.

    - Item (MVP):
        - Make a table for items.
        - Consensus and Rankings should BOTH have pointers to items.

    - Add option so that the creator can approve suggestions to the main ranking. (FINAL)
        - Option to block adding suggestions.

Moving Forward:

    - MVP (due this Wednesday)
        - MVP should be a working app:
            - User can log in, create a ranking, share it (publicly or privately) and others can vote on ite.
            - The user can then close a ranking and see the consensus.
        - IN ADDITION:
             - Add special instructions inf necessary for Harihar.
             - Write down features we support.

    - Revised Design Doc (due next Monday)
